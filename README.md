# Valheim Sorted Menus

This mod sorts the cooking, crafting and skills menu by configurable parameters.

Since this does not actually change the UI itself, only the list used to create it, this is compatible with almost all UI mods.

# New repo?

This mod lived its early days in my mini mod repo: https://github.com/Goldenrevolver/ValheimMiniMods
But with its complexity and configuration options, it stopped being a mini mod a long time ago, so it deserved its own repository.
